Abstract:

CineQuest is a sophisticated movie recommendation system designed to provide personalized film suggestions based on individual user preferences. By seamlessly integrating content-based filtering, CineQuest delivers recommendations that align with users' tastes and viewing history. Users can specify their favorite genres, actors, and actresses, allowing CineQuest to tailor suggestions that highlight films featuring their preferred genres or starring their favorite performers, and doesnâ€™t recommend previously recommended movies.
